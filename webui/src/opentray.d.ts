 * Ambient types for the OpenTray window bridge injected into the page when the

 * (`nativeWindowApi: true` with either native overlay or frameless chrome).
 *
 * The webui bundle does NOT import `@opentray/ext-webview` (it ships native
 * binaries and is backend-only), so this file is the page-side source of truth
 * for `navigator.opentrayWindow`. It mirrors the relevant subset of the
 * extension's `WebviewNavigatorWindow` / `WebviewWindowOverlay` shapes — only
 * the surface the drag strip + overlay geometry actually use. When the page
 * runs in a plain browser (no native host) these properties are simply absent.
 *
 * Keep this aligned with `@opentray/ext-webview`'s
 * `WebviewWindowOverlay` / `WebviewNavigatorWindow` (see ext-webview types).
